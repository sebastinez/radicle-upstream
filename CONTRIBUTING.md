# Your first bugfix

If you have an issue you know how to fix or see an [open issue][oi] you'd like
to fix, we are keen to receive your contributions.

We are currently accepting [PR's through GitHub][pr] while we make our own
infrastructure more robust. If it's your first time using GitHub Pull Requests,
learn more about it [here][ghf].

We also accept contributions through [Upstream Patches][up], our first version
of Pull Requests in Upstream. Learn more about the contribution flow [here][cbf].
For us to see you've contributed a Patch we need to [add your Radicle ID as a
remote][ar] to our repo, you can either add it to the [Remotes to track
issue][rtr] or email it to [julien@monadic.xyz][mt].

# Documentation

We're writing documentation as we are developing new features if you find
